## How it works

This timer works using a 2 digit sev seg display, a button, a switch, and a 100 khz clock. When the switch is flipped, the display counts down by 1 each minute, or 6000000 ticks of the clock, until it reachs 0. 

## How to test

Make sure the switch is to the left. Press the button until the display shows the desired number of minutes. Then hit the switch and watch the display count down every minute until 0! 

## External hardware

You need a 2+ digit sevseg display with common cathode, a button, and a switch. Also external power.
